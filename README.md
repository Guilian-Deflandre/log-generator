# Log Generator
This project simulate a network log file generation for log formatted in a way respecting a Logstash regex. Logstash use regular expressions (regex) to collect information from a log file. The goal of this script is to simulate the feeding of a log file aggregated in a SYSLOG device and read by a Logstash process.
